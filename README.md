# solidarity
a solid based chat app

UI Notes:
Breakpoints at 320, 650, 980;  also because of the nature of these types of multi-user chats it will need to use fluid sizing to make best use of the available screen space.

Code notes:
Try to use standard solid libaries where possible.
Bundle code and graphics to make the install process as easy as possible.

Features:
basically a gitter-ish style chat;  the artwork ui design will dictate the features.
