# solidarity
a solid based chat app

ui notes:
breakpoints at 320, 650, 980; also because of the nature of these types of multi-user chats it will need to use fluid sizing to make best use of the available screen space.

code notes:
try to use standard solid libaries where possible.
bundle code and graphics to make the install process as easy as possible.

features:
basically a gitter-ish style chat;  the artwork ui design will dictate the features.
